# NettySimulation

NettySimulation is a modular Babylon/Vite TypeScript workspace prepared for building the Netty simulator. The codebase is partitioned into engine, simulation, DSL, and UI layers so each system can evolve independently.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – bundle the project for production.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.

## Development Notes

The source tree under `src/` contains placeholder modules with header comments only. Implement functionality module by module, beginning with the engine bootstrap and simulation world.
